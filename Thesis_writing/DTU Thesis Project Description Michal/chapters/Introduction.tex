% This section should describe what is in this document and what thesis is about as a concept at DTU

The following document is the first version of project plan designed for the execution of the master's thesis titled \textit{Network Latency Mitigation through Data-Oriented Design in Fast-Paced Multiplayer Online Games}. The plan is segmented into four primary sections which should provide a clear understanding of the thesis's scope and objectives, as well as grasp of the essential fundamentals necessary for comprehending the entirety of the work: \textbf{Context overview} which provides a background on problem of network latency in multiplayer online games, a \textbf{Detailed Project Description} offering an in-depth exploration of the methodologies, tools, and techniques that will be used to complete this thesis, a \textbf{Risk Assessment} identifying potential risks and challenges associated with the project's execution and proposing solution, and a specification of significant \textbf{Milestones} outlining the key deliverables to be achieved throughout the project's duration.\newline

The primary objectives of this thesis align with the learning outcomes outlined by the MSc Eng programme at DTU \cite{DTU_master}. These objectives include among others identifying and reflecting on related technical scientific issues, applying current research to develop new solutions, mastering technical scientific methodologies, theories, and tools relevant to the problem and working independently with reflecting on personal learning, academic development, and specialization.\newline

By aligning with those learning objectives and adhering to the outlined structure, this project plan aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the successful execution of the master's thesis.\newline
